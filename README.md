# Mob 6 2d Games

## Prerequisites

Mob 1, or basic iOS and Swift, SA.

## Course Overview

Building 2d games with SpriteKit and Swift. Students will create their own games
using fundamental concepts of game creation like sprites, cartesian coordinate
systems, Actions, 2d physics, and more!

Students will study game design, level design, and game balance.

Students will look at color and design in games.

## Objectives

1. Students will work with SpriteKit, Swift, and Xcode.
1. Level design
1. Designing game assets
1. Planning game balance for quality game play
1. Look at patterns like Entity component structure and State machine

## Competencies

1. Build games using Xcode, SpriteKit and Swift.
1. Design levels for games that they conceive.
1. Identify various tradeoffs of each architecture and select best fit for game.
1. Design games with interesting and engaging game play through careful game balance.
