# Class 2 - Workshop

Working with Sprites and Actions making Smove

## SKAction 

> An object that is executed by an SKNode to change its structure or content.

Actions provide a system to make things happen. Actions can transform sprites
move, scale, rotate, animate textures, etc. They can also play sounds and run 
blocks of code. 

Actions can also be grouped and sequenced. For example you can group a move
and rotate action together to make an object move and rotate. You could 
create a sequence of actions that would make an object move, then rotate, 
then scale. 

## In class challenge 

Make the most bombastic amazeballs animation using actions. This animation 
should introduce your game.

Students pair up to work in class. 

Everyone shows their work at the end of class and vote in Slack.
